# Project C
The aim of this project is to add some more advanced features to the system developed in Project B. The features to be added are:

• Sort the players with more speciﬁc rules

• Handling of invalid input via Exceptions

• Write (read) the game statistics into (from) a ﬁle, i.e., one which is stored on the hard disk between executions of Nimsys

• A new type of player - an AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) player, whose moves are automatically determined by the computer rather than a game user

• A victory guaranteed strategy for the AI player
