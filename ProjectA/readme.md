# Project A

This project is the ﬁrst in a series of three, with the ultimate objective of designing and implementing (in Java) a simple variant of the game of Nim. It is a two player game, and the rules of the version used here are as follows:

• The game begins with a number of objects (e.g., stones placed on a table).

• Each player takes turns removing stones from the table.

• On each turn, a player must remove at least one stone. In addition, there is an upper bound on the number of stones that can be removed in a single turn. For example, if this upper bound is 3, a player has the choice of removing 1, 2 or 3 stones on each turn.

• The game ends when there are no more stones remaining. The player who removes the last stone, loses. The other player is, of course, the winner.

• Both the initial number of stones, and the upper bound on the number that can be removed, can be varied from game to game, and must be chosen before a game commences.
