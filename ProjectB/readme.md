This project (Project B),will continue with the same theme introduced in Project A - namely, an implementation of the game of Nim. 

Please refer to the Project A speciﬁcation for a description of the game and its rules.

In Project A, a simple Java program was created to handle Nim’s core game play mechanics. 
In the next two projects, the objective is to design and implement a more complete version of Nim, making full use of Java’s object-oriented paradigm.
